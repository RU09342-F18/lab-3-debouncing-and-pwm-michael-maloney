## Software PWM

This program is much more complex than the harware PWM program.  This is because the PWM is not directly connected to the pin.  Instead, interrupts were used to toggle an LED on and off.  A timer interrupt is used in the up mode.  An initial value is selected as half of the wanted 1kHz to make the duty cycle 50%.  After every button press, a variable is incremented by 10% and another is decremented by 10% to add up to the total value wanted for a 1kHz CCR value for the timer interrupt.  One of these variables is set to the CCR value of the timer every single timer interrupt, only to be replaced by the other variable the next interrupt.  This allows for a pseudo-PWM signal because the two always equal a 1kHz signal, only with different on and off times for the LED.
